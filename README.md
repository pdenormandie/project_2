# project_2. Our project was difficult from inception. Only after about a week did we realize we were creating a nucleaur divice. Our PCA was step one in refinding our uranium, the TSNE enriched it. We then attempted a lense version of the bomb, but that was too difficult to engineer although I figured out the theoretical issues, it would now merely be an issue of building it. Essential there are paralell pixels that cause the reaction to fizzle, one of the two parts of the couple need to be randomly deleted, and then the data exposed. In the end we chose to attemp a gun type explosion divice, however, only very late did we realize that we needed to invert the aiming divice as really we needed to shoot the uranium rather than the 'target.'
that being said the lense type is signigicantly more efficient in terms of data creation. possible upgrades include the lense type of bomb and potetially fusion type bomb.
